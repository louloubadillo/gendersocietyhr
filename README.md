# Gender, Society and Human Rights 101

The final project of the subject was to find an innovative way of sharing something we learned in class. <br>

We decided to develop a website, where we could share resources regarding the topics we discussed in class. 

The project is available at: <a href="https://feminism.louloubadillo.com/" target="_blank"> feminism.louloubadillo.com</a>
